To run an SSL/TLS scan on Windows (via 'testssl.sh') I recommend one of these options:

1. Cygwin

- Download https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/releases
- Download https://www.cygwin.com/install.html
- Run Cygwin installer and choose the packages you need, including the 'bash' package
- Start the Cygwin Terminal
- Change to the directory where 'testssl.sh' is located and run the analysis using 'bash':
-- Ex. bash testssl.sh -f -g -p -U -s --hints https://www.spacex.com

2. MSYS2

- Download https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/releases
- Download https://www.msys2.org/
- Run MSYS2 installer and follow the installation instructions
- Start the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal
- Change to the directory where 'testssl.sh' is located and run the analyisis using 'bash':
-- Ex. bash testssl.sh -f -g -p -U -s --hints https://www.spacex.com

3. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

- Download https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/releases
- Follow WSL instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
- Open the installed Linux distribution from the Start menu or use 'wsl' from the Command Prompt
- Change to the directory where 'testssl.sh' is located and run the analyisis using 'bash':
-- Ex. bash testssl.sh -f -g -p -U -s --hints https://www.spacex.com
